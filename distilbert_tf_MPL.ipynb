the time', 'i avoid being depressed or worried about anything', 'the main thing that makes me self-motivated is to make my parents to be proud of their daughter and give the all the happiness that they need, which is what that makes me happy and gives me satisfaction in what i do', 'once upon a time a friend of mine was giving me advice on some personal problem', 'i thought at that time that she was interfering unnecessarily in my life and she told me continously not to do what i am doing so, i stopped talking to her', 'but at later stage of my life i realised that she was correct and i misjudged her completely', 'i am a consistent performer and hard worker', 'a person from outside has varied experiences and has higher chances of improving certain aspects of an organisation than a

our mind was self driving cars', 'most of the teams started implementing their ideas of self-driving cars, but all in vain because lets face it building a self-driving car in twenty four hours is next to impossible', 'at that moment, i parted myself from the traditional way of thinking about innovations and came up with an idea which will enhance the experience of the driver', 'i came up with the idea of sentiment analysis of the passengers in the car and thought of changing the inside atmosphere of the car based on the current overall mood of the passengers', 'this worked well and the judges

before the people i spent extra efforts to learn the same', 'the toughest decision was whether to join syntel and start working or to go for post graduation', 'and i chose post graduation as i felt give the amount of potential in my and my passion for my stream i can learn much better in higher studies', 'seriously speaking i never want to do a job until i had something to learn to gain from the

hard work and no smart work and gotten literally no success', 'you should always work hard to improve your knowledge, and once you have your knowledge you can always do smart work', 'if you try to take shortcuts when you are learning, try to do smart work, you will never end up solving any problems', 'it was a project where the estimations of efforts and analysis of change done by the person was wrong and i was incharge of development of that product', 'i found out a way to convince my onsite counter part to buy a small amount of time as much as he can, and planned to break down the problems in small deliverables which would be given to the client one by one', 'so that we will get more time to develop and the deliverables also does not get delayed', 'because even if the requirement is delivered at once, tester will verify one by one so why not deliver in pieces', 'was awarded by my leads for handling this', 'these two are very interrelated, as low salary will affect your daily survival and low job satisfaction will end you in depression', 'so according to me bit of both is required', 'success according to me is that you started something which you are scared of

to prepare for my engineering entrance exams and board exams i had to study many hours and work hard to improve my performance', 'i then decided to prioritise my goals, and i realised that doing things which affect long term results are much important than things which give short term results', 'i decided to study for my engineering entrance exams more when compared to board exams because college is a place where we spend our crucial period of life, where we learn and get geared up for the career', 'though getting good marks in board exams is also important but making it into a good engineering college is more important', 'thus i was able to make a decision and reduce my workload', 'i think joining iiitb has been my best career decision so far', 'i was inspired by a lot of people in my life', 'the first being my parents', 'my mom and dad inspired me a lot in every step of my life and they still keep doing it', 'they taught how to handle things, how to treat people, how to

was me who took that decision', 'not yet as there is lots to achieve in terms of gaining knowledge and excellence', 'my friends and teachers told me that i am very good in exploring new things to solve a problem, and that part is very useful when we stuck with some problem, and we need out of the box thinking', 'time is the main pillar of success, if you do not give priority to your time and waste your time in useless work you will not be succesful', 'actually in pressure i tend to work faster with less mistakes', 'i think it is very important to balance your life', 'we should work hard but at the same time we would manage our time for our family and friends', 'so to manage this i worked hard in week days some time burn the midnight oil for the whole night and in weekends i go out with my family and friends', 'i call my parents daily and talk to them for half an hour but i do that in the evening after done with my studies and that time is reserved to relax', 'i follow the well

'person a tries to go to each and every shop to find that one perfect case for his phone, whereas person b gets a printout of a picture of that case, buys a transparent phone case, puts the picture to it and uses it, as it exactly resembles the case he wanted', 'here what person b did was smart work and what person a did was hard work', 'even though b finally got the case he wanted, he put in a lot of effort to do so, whereas a was smart enough to do what he did', 'people say hard work pays off, which is true, but when needed one should be smart enough to get things done easily', 'there are many situations where only working hard would make one achieve their goal', 'for example, passing an exam', 'being smart enough to cheat in a exam to pass is not smart work, though you pass the exam',
